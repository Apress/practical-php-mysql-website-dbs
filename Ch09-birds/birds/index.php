<h2>Help Save Our Devon Birds From Extinction</h2>
<div id="mid-left-col">
<p class="dark">The Devon Bird Reserves were established in an effort to combat 
the massive decline in the bird population due to intensive farming. <br>The reserves are pesticide-free havens for birds and other wildlife. They provide an ideal habitat where birds are able to nest and safely search for food. </p>
	<p class="dark">The reserves have comfortable bird hides where you may 
	observe the wildlife without disturbing it. Each hide has an information 
	panel and also a chalk board where you can inform others about your 
	sightings. </p>
