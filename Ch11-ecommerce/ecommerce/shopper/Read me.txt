USER: colossus  HOST: localhost PASSWORD: firstcomputer  DATABASE: shopperdb
The listing for the database connection file included in the downloads is as follows:

<?php 
// Create a connection to the shopperdb database
DEFINE ('DB_USER', 'colossus');
DEFINE ('DB_PASSWORD', 'firstcomputer');
DEFINE ('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
DEFINE ('DB_NAME', 'shopperdb');
// Make the connection:
$dbcon = @mysqli_connect (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME) 
OR die ('Could not connect to MySQL: ' . mysqli_connect_error() );
// Set the encoding
mysqli_set_charset($dbc, 'utf8');
?>

When you have complete steps 1 to 3, you can begin to explore the PayPal shopping cart web site.

To access the web site type http://localhost/shopper/  into the adress field of a browser.

The home page (index.php) is the search page, and because it is not hard coded, you will be able to search for any categerory of painting in the pull down lists.
You will need to be online to see the PayPal buttons. 
Don't click the PayPal buttons because they contain dummy information, PayPal will respond with an error message.

Because the pages use dummy information, the PayPal shopping cart will not be actioned.
